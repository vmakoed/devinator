# UC001: Start Mission

## Use Case Overview

**Use Case ID:** UC001
**Use Case Name:** Start Mission
**Actor:** Development Team Lead
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Not Started

## Description

As a development team lead, I want to start a new mission so that I can organize my ticket analysis workflow and begin the process of identifying suitable tickets for AI assignment. I also want to view all my previously created missions to track my workflow progress.

## Pre-conditions

- User has access to the Devinator application
- System is operational and responsive

## Post-conditions

- New mission is created with a unique identifier and auto-generated name
- Mission status is set to "draft"
- User is redirected to the next step (JQL query input)
- Mission is ready to accept JQL queries

## Main Flow

1. User navigates to the Devinator application homepage
2. User views list of all previously created missions (if any)
3. User clicks "Start New Mission" button
3. System automatically generates mission name (e.g., "Mission - [Current Date/Time]")
4. System creates new mission with auto-generated name and status "draft"
5. System displays success confirmation with mission name
6. System redirects user to UC002 (Input JQL Query) page

## Alternative Flows

### AF1: System Error
**Step 4 Alternative:**
- If system cannot create mission:
  - System displays error message "Unable to create mission. Please try again."
  - System logs the error for debugging
  - User can retry from step 2

## Business Rules

- BR01: Mission name is auto-generated using format "Mission - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]"
- BR02: Each mission gets a unique system-generated ID
- BR03: Mission starts in "draft" status
- BR04: Mission creation timestamp is automatically recorded

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC01: User can create a mission with a single click
- AC02: Mission name is automatically generated and displayed to user
- AC03: Mission is assigned a unique identifier
- AC04: Mission status is set to "draft" upon creation
- AC05: User is redirected to JQL query input after successful creation
- AC06: Success message shows the auto-generated mission name
- AC07: Error messages are displayed for system failures
- AC08: Homepage displays all previously created missions in descending chronological order
- AC09: Each mission in the list shows name, creation date, and current status

## UI/UX Requirements

- Single "Start New Mission" button on homepage
- Success message should display the generated mission name
- Navigation to next step should be immediate and clear
- Loading indicator during mission creation
- Mission list displays with clear visual hierarchy and status indicators
- Empty state message when no missions exist to guide user to first action

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Mission creation should complete within 2 seconds
- Auto-generated names should be unique and meaningful
- Error handling should be graceful and user-friendly

## Dependencies

- Database connection for mission storage
- System clock for timestamp generation

## Test Scenarios

### TS001: Successful Mission Creation
**Given:** User is on the homepage
**When:** User clicks "Start New Mission"
**Then:** Mission is created with auto-generated name and user is redirected to JQL input page

### TS002: System Error Handling
**Given:** Database is unavailable
**When:** User clicks "Start New Mission"
**Then:** Error message is displayed and user can retry

### TS003: Unique Name Generation
**Given:** User creates multiple missions
**When:** User clicks "Start New Mission" multiple times
**Then:** Each mission gets a unique auto-generated name

## Notes

- This streamlined approach removes friction from mission creation
- Auto-generated names ensure consistency and eliminate validation needs
- Users can focus on the core workflow without setup overhead
- Mission naming format can be adjusted based on user feedback
