# UC004: Analyze Tickets

## Use Case Overview

**Use Case ID:** UC004
**Use Case Name:** Analyze Tickets
**Actor:** Development Team Lead
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Not Started

## Description

As a development team lead, I want to analyze the complexity of fetched JIRA tickets so that I can identify low-complexity bugs that are suitable for automated resolution by the AI engineer (Devin).

## Pre-conditions

- User has an active mission with confirmed tickets (from UC003)
- Mission is in "in_progress" status
- Tickets are stored in the system
- User has reviewed and confirmed the ticket list

## Post-conditions

- Each ticket has a complexity score assigned
- Tickets are categorized by complexity level (low, medium, high)
- Low-complexity bugs are identified and flagged for AI assignment
- System is ready to recommend tickets for Devin (UC005)
- Analysis results are stored with the mission

## Main Flow

1. User navigates to Analyze Tickets page from Preview Tickets page (UC003)
2. System displays loading indicator with "Analyzing ticket complexity..." message
3. System retrieves stored tickets for the mission
4. For each ticket, system analyzes complexity based on:
   - Description length and clarity
   - Number of comments
   - Number of linked issues
   - Labels indicating complexity (e.g., "quick-win", "technical-debt")
   - Priority level
   - Time in backlog
   - Issue type (bug vs. task vs. story)
5. System assigns complexity score (1-10) to each ticket
6. System categorizes tickets:
   - Low complexity: score 1-3
   - Medium complexity: score 4-7
   - High complexity: score 8-10
7. System displays analysis results in organized view:
   - Summary statistics (count by complexity category)
   - Sortable/filterable ticket list with complexity indicators
   - Visual breakdown (chart/graph of complexity distribution)
8. System highlights low-complexity bugs suitable for AI assignment
9. User reviews analysis results
10. User clicks "View Recommendations" button
11. System navigates to Ticket Recommendations page (UC005)

## Alternative Flows

### AF1: No Low-Complexity Tickets Found
**Step 8 Alternative:**
- If no tickets meet low-complexity criteria:
  - System displays message "No low-complexity bugs found in this batch"
  - System suggests adjusting JQL query to find simpler tickets
  - System provides option to return to UC002 to modify query
  - User can still view all tickets with complexity scores
  - Process continues but UC005 may have no recommendations

### AF2: Analysis Error
**Step 4 Alternative:**
- If complexity analysis fails for specific tickets:
  - System logs error for debugging
  - System assigns neutral/unknown complexity score
  - System continues analyzing remaining tickets
  - System displays warning indicator on affected tickets
  - Analysis completes with partial results

### AF3: All Tickets High Complexity
**Step 6 Alternative:**
- If all tickets are high complexity:
  - System displays message explaining results
  - System recommends refining JQL query for simpler work items
  - User can review detailed complexity factors
  - System provides option to return to UC002

## Business Rules

- BR01: Only tickets with type "Bug" are considered for AI assignment
- BR02: Low-complexity threshold is score 1-3
- BR03: Complexity score is based on objective factors, not subjective assessment
- BR04: Tickets must have minimum information to be analyzable (description required)
- BR05: Analysis results are stored and can be re-displayed without re-analysis
- BR06: User cannot manually override complexity scores (future enhancement)

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC01: All stored tickets are analyzed for complexity
- AC02: Each ticket receives a complexity score (1-10)
- AC03: Tickets are categorized into low/medium/high complexity groups
- AC04: Summary statistics show count of tickets in each category
- AC05: Visual breakdown (chart) displays complexity distribution
- AC06: Low-complexity bugs are clearly highlighted/flagged
- AC07: User can sort tickets by complexity score
- AC08: User can filter tickets by complexity category
- AC09: Complexity factors are visible for each ticket (on hover or expand)
- AC10: Loading indicator shows progress during analysis
- AC11: System handles tickets with missing data gracefully
- AC12: "View Recommendations" navigation is clearly presented

## UI/UX Requirements

- Loading spinner with progress indicator during analysis
- Summary card showing:
  - Total tickets analyzed
  - Count in each complexity category (low/medium/high)
  - Number of low-complexity bugs identified
- Visual chart (bar or pie) showing complexity distribution
- Ticket table/list with:
  - Complexity score badge (color-coded: green=low, yellow=medium, red=high)
  - Key ticket fields (ID, title, status, priority)
  - Sort controls (by complexity, priority, created date)
  - Filter controls (by complexity category, issue type)
  - Expandable row to show complexity factors
- Special highlight/badge for low-complexity bugs suitable for AI
- Clear "View Recommendations" button to proceed to UC005
- Breadcrumb navigation showing current step in workflow
- Option to return to previous step if needed

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Analysis should complete within 5 seconds for up to 100 tickets
- System should handle up to 500 tickets without performance degradation
- Complexity algorithm should be deterministic (same ticket = same score)
- Analysis results should be cached to avoid re-computation
- System should log complexity scoring details for audit/debugging

## Dependencies

- Confirmed tickets from UC003
- Mission entity with ticket storage
- Complexity scoring algorithm/service
- Chart/visualization library for UI

## Test Scenarios

### TS001: Successful Analysis with Mixed Complexity
**Given:** Mission has 50 tickets with varying characteristics
**When:** User navigates to Analyze Tickets page
**Then:** All tickets analyzed, scores assigned, distribution shown in summary and chart

### TS002: Low-Complexity Bugs Identified
**Given:** Mission includes 10 simple bugs
**When:** Analysis completes
**Then:** Low-complexity bugs are highlighted and counted in summary

### TS003: No Low-Complexity Tickets
**Given:** All tickets are medium or high complexity
**When:** Analysis completes
**Then:** System displays appropriate message and suggests query refinement

### TS004: Filter by Complexity Category
**Given:** Analysis results are displayed
**When:** User filters by "Low Complexity"
**Then:** Only tickets with score 1-3 are shown in list

### TS005: Sort by Complexity Score

**Then:** Tickets are reordered from lowest to highest score

### TS006: View Complexity Factors
**Given:** Analysis results are displayed
**When:** User expands a ticket row
**Then:** Detailed complexity factors and their contributions are shown

### TS007: Navigate to Recommendations
**Given:** User has reviewed analysis results
**When:** User clicks "View Recommendations"
**Then:** System navigates to UC005 (Ticket Recommendations)

## Notes

- Complexity scoring algorithm should be transparent and explainable
- Consider using heuristics initially, with option to integrate ML in future
- Store complexity scores to track accuracy over time
- Future enhancement: Allow user to provide feedback on complexity accuracy
- Future enhancement: Machine learning to improve scoring based on actual resolution outcomes
- Consider integrating with JIRA's built-in complexity/story points if available
