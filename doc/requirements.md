# Requirements

## User Flow

The system follows this workflow:

1. **Session Creation**: A user starts a new "Session" to begin the ticket analysis process
2. **JQL Query Input**: User enters a JQL (JIRA Query Language) query to define which bug tickets to fetch
3. **Ticket Fetching**: System fetches matching tickets from the JIRA API and displays them in a list
4. **Ticket Review**: User reviews and confirms the list of fetched tickets
5. **Complexity Analysis**: System analyzes each ticket and scores them based on complexity heuristics (title length, description presence, labels, etc.)
6. **Recommendations**: System recommends which tickets are suitable for assignment to Devin based on complexity scores
7. **Final Selection**: User reviews recommendations and confirms the final selection of tickets
8. **Assignment**: System assigns selected tickets to Devin (simulated via logging or Slack message)
