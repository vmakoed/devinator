Create or update doc/requirements.md with the requirements from the doc/vision.md
The file contains, functional requirements and non-functional requirements as Markdown tables.
Each requirement has a unique id, a description (as a user story) and a priority, and a status.
Only include requirements for MVP. 
Ignore scalability, user management, roles, security, analytics, integrations (unless explicitly mentioned).
Focus on implementing one happy-path use case end-to-end.
